# Quiz_App
A quiz App created by Kotlin in which 6 questions will be displayed.  
At last summary sheet will be shown how much you answered correctly and which answers were right and wrong.
This was achieved by basic Kotlin Features, tool and libraries.
I used images, lists, maps, google fonts, etc. to change the appearance and to enhance the functioning of the app.
